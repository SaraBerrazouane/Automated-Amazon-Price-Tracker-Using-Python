# Automated-Amazon-Price-Tracker-Using-Python
In this project, I developed an automated web scraper using Python to track the price of a product on Amazon. The script fetches the product title and price daily, appending the data to a CSV file for historical analysis. This project demonstrates my skills in web scraping, data management, and automation.
